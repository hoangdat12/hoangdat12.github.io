**Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)** is a service on AWS to deploy, manage and scale containerized application using Kubernetes, a container orchestration service managed by AWS eliminats the need to install, operate and maintain the Kubernetes control plane on AWS

**Jenkins** is an open source used to implement continuous integration functionality (called **CI â€“ Continuous Integration**) and build automation tasks. It manages and controls several stages of the software deployment process including building, documentation, automated testing, packaging, and static code analysis.

**CICD** stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment, is process that combine automation to help speed up product development and bring products to end users

In this lab, we will create a simple **Kubernetes Cluster** on **AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**. Then, we will deploy the application site on the cluster and use **Jenkins** to deploy.
